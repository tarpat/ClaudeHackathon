Create a React Native (Expo) mobile app called "MedClarify" that helps patients understand medical documents by scanning them with their camera or uploading files.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Scan medical documents using device camera (real-time document capture)
2. Upload medical documents (PDF or photo from gallery)
3. Extract text from scanned/uploaded documents
4. Use Claude API to translate medical jargon into plain language
5. Use Claude API to answer clarification questions about the document
6. Block requests for additional medical advice with guardrails

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Expo SDK 51
- React Native Paper for UI components
- expo-camera for real-time document scanning
- expo-document-picker for PDF uploads
- expo-image-picker for gallery photo uploads
- expo-image-manipulator for image processing (crop, enhance)
- Direct Claude API integration (Anthropic API)
- Use claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model

KEY FEATURES:

1. Home Screen:
   - Two primary options:
     * "Scan Document" button (camera icon) → Opens camera
     * "Upload from Files" button (folder icon) → Opens file picker
   - Recent documents list (optional)
   - Prominent disclaimer at top

2. Camera Scanning:
   - Full-screen camera view with expo-camera
   - Document detection overlay (rectangle frame showing where to position document)
   - Auto-capture when document is detected (or manual capture button)
   - Flash toggle for low-light conditions
   - After capture: crop/enhance interface
   - "Retake" and "Use This Photo" buttons
   - Send processed image to Claude API for text extraction and translation

3. File Upload:
   - Support PDF files (expo-document-picker)
   - Support images from gallery (expo-image-picker)
   - Preview uploaded file before processing
   - Extract text and send to Claude API

4. Translation Screen:
   - Display original text (scrollable, top half)
   - Display simplified version (scrollable, bottom half)
   - Show confidence score for each section (0-100) with color-coded progress bars
   - Highlight medical terms with inline tap-to-see definitions
   - Display persistent "This is not medical advice - consult your doctor" banner
   - Action items section (e.g., "Follow up in 2 weeks")
   - "Ask Questions" button → Navigate to Q&A screen

5. Q&A Chat (Clarification Questions):
   - Chat interface with message bubbles
   - User can ask clarification questions about document content
   - Claude API responds ONLY based on document content (no additional medical advice)
   - Implement guardrails:
     * Questions like "Should I take this medication?" → "I can only explain what's in your document. Please consult your doctor for medical advice."
     * Questions about info not in document → "That information is not in this document. Please ask your healthcare provider."
   - Show "Claude is thinking..." loading state
   - Display conversation history
   - Persistent disclaimer at bottom: "This is not medical advice"

6. Trust & Safety:
   - Confidence indicators throughout (visual progress bars: green=high, yellow=medium, red=low)
   - Clear disclaimers on every screen
   - Handle Claude API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
   - Show when Claude is uncertain (display confidence scores)
   - Privacy: process locally, option to delete documents after session
   - "Report Issue" button for feedback

CLAUDE API INTEGRATION:

Translation System Prompt:
"You are a medical document translator helping patients understand their medical records.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Translate medical jargon into plain, everyday language
2. Maintain 100% accuracy - do not oversimplify important clinical details
3. Highlight any urgent findings or required action items
4. Provide a confidence score (0-100) for each section based on clarity of the original text
5. DO NOT provide additional medical advice beyond what's in the document
6. If something is unclear or ambiguous, explicitly state: 'This section is unclear - please ask your doctor to clarify'
7. Identify the document type (Lab Results, Discharge Summary, Diagnosis, Prescription, etc.)

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE AS VALID JSON:
{
  \"documentType\": \"Lab Results | Discharge Summary | Diagnosis | Prescription | Imaging Report | etc\",
  \"simplifiedSections\": [
    {
      \"title\": \"Section name (e.g., 'Blood Test Results', 'Diagnosis')\",
      \"original\": \"Original medical text\",
      \"simplified\": \"Plain language explanation\",
      \"confidence\": 85,
      \"urgency\": \"normal | important | urgent\",
      \"keyTerms\": [
        {\"term\": \"medical term\", \"definition\": \"simple definition\"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  \"actionItems\": [
    \"Follow up with cardiologist in 2 weeks\",
    \"Schedule MRI within 30 days\"
  ],
  \"overallSummary\": \"One-paragraph summary in plain language\",
  \"uncertainties\": [
    \"Section about X is unclear due to abbreviation - ask your doctor\"
  ]
}

If processing an image, first extract all visible text, then translate it."

Q&A System Prompt:
"You are answering clarification questions about a patient's medical document.

STRICT GUARDRAILS:
1. ONLY answer questions using information explicitly stated in the document
2. DO NOT provide additional medical advice, recommendations, or interpretations beyond the document
3. DO NOT answer 'what should I do?' questions - redirect to healthcare provider
4. If asked for medical advice, respond exactly: 'I can only explain what's in your document. Please consult your doctor for medical advice about your specific situation.'
5. If information is not in the document, respond: 'That specific information is not mentioned in this document. Please ask your healthcare provider.'
6. Never diagnose, suggest treatments, or interpret test results beyond what's written
7. Always encourage consulting with healthcare providers for medical decisions

DOCUMENT CONTENT:
{documentContext}

PREVIOUS CONVERSATION:
{conversationHistory}

USER QUESTION: {userQuestion}

Provide a clear, helpful answer that explains what's in the document without adding medical advice."

HUMAN-IN-LOOP DESIGN:
- AI assists understanding, humans make all health decisions
- Clear handoff points: "Consult your doctor about..."
- Never replace healthcare provider judgment
- Display confidence scores (users know when to seek clarification)
- Prominent disclaimers on every screen
- "This is educational only, not medical advice" messaging
- Handle AI/human disagreement: Always defer to healthcare provider

UI/UX DESIGN:
- React Native Paper components throughout
- Color scheme:
  * Primary: Medical blue (#2196F3)
  * Confidence high: Green (#4CAF50)
  * Confidence medium: Amber (#FFC107)
  * Confidence low/urgent: Red (#F44336)
- Typography: Minimum 16px body text, 24px headers
- Accessibility:
  * WCAG AA contrast ratios
  * Screen reader labels on all interactive elements
  * Touch targets minimum 48x48 dp
- Loading states: Use ActivityIndicator with meaningful messages
- Error states: Friendly messages with actionable solutions
- Smooth page transitions with react-navigation
- Bottom tab navigation for main screens

ERROR HANDLING:
- Camera permission denied → "MedClarify needs camera access to scan documents. Tap here to open Settings."
- Network error → "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection and try again."
- Claude API error → "Translation service temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a moment."
- Low confidence → Warning badge: "This section may need verification with your doctor"
- Invalid document → "Unable to read this document clearly. Try retaking with better lighting."
- Rate limit → "Please wait a moment before processing another document."

SCREENS FLOW:
1. HomeScreen → Choose scan or upload
2. CameraScanScreen → Capture document → Preview/crop
3. Processing overlay → "Analyzing document..."
4. TranslationScreen → View results → Tap "Ask Questions"
5. QAScreen → Chat interface for clarifications
